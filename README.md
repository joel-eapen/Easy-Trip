# Challenges I ran into
As a beginner, I faced some difficulties while integrating the OpenAI API into my website. The API provides access to advanced machine learning features, making it a powerful tool for developers. However, integrating it into a website requires a deep understanding of programming concepts, which can be difficult for new developers to grasp.

One of the main challenges I faced was figuring out how to integrate the OpenAI API into my website. This required a solid understanding of web development frameworks such as Gradio and programming languages such as Python. It was essential to understand how to use the API to retrieve data and integrate it into the website.

Another challenge was to optimize the website for performance and user experience. I had to make sure the website was responsive, fast and easy to use. This required knowledge of web design and development best practices, as well as a good understanding of user behavior.

Despite the challenges I faced, I was able to overcome them and create a functional and user-friendly travel itinerary website. The project allowed me to improve my skills and gain valuable experience in web development and API integration.
